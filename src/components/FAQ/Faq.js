                <Paragraph > The meetup is designed to bring together dog
                     owners who share a common interest in going 
                     for walks with their dogs. It's an opportunity
                      to socialise, share experiences, and enjoy the
                       company of fellow dog enthusiasts.</Paragraph >

                 evenings to accommodate different schedules.
                  Locations vary, and details for each walk,
                   including meeting points, are shared in advance
                    on the Meetup page and through event notifications.</Paragraph >

                 If your dog is still in the process of socialisation,
                  please ensure they are comfortable around other dogs.
                   It's important to be mindful of the group dynamic to

                 All dogs should be on a leash, and owners
                  are responsible for cleaning up after their pets. 
                  Additionally, be aware of the needs and comfort

                Depending on the weather, it's advisable
